//		Design a simple crypto exchange platform, emphasizing the concepts in
//		boldface. Implement some simple functionality where appropriate and write
//		unit tests that exercise this logic.
//		A commercial exchange would take months to develop, so in this exercise I will be looking at your ability to apply the design principles
//		discussed in class to an artificial problem. You do not need to implement
//		a GUI or CLI. You do not need persistance, nor networking support. The
//		requirements below are not fully specified, but hopefully not conflicting. It
//		will be up to you to interpret these in a way that respects the intention of the
//		client (the examiner).
//		An exchange platform is a facility where traders can buy and sell different
//		kinds of CRYPTO for FIAT currencies. Users of the exchange have to
//		REGISTER and be APPROVED by the ADMINISTRATORS in order to
//		use the system. Therefore there are two types of users: TRADERS and
//		ADMINISTRATORS. To be able to trade a CRYPTO on this stock exchange.
//		There are various kinds of CRYPTO, each having its own information: total
//		supply, decimals, symbol, etc.
//		The exchange platform maintains an ORDER BOOK.
//		Orders can be BUY ORDERS, SELL ORDERS. Each order can also can
//		be a MARKET order or LIMIT order. Orders are placed by a trader, and
//		include a QUANTITY. In addition they have a BID or ASK price in case
//		they’re buying or selling respectively. Market orders do not have a bid or ask
//		price. When orders are sent to the platform, the platform places these on
//		the order book, which is visible to every trader. The system will try to FILL
//		orders by matching buy and sell order prices together using a MATCHING
//		ENGINE. This can be done by maintaining a sorted (by price) data structure
//		of orders and matching these in a first-come first-served manner. Some orders
//		will be FILLED, some won’t and some will be partially FILLED. Orders that
//		3
//		Figure 1: An order book in a real exchange (sorted by price).
//		Figure 2: Examples of orders in an exchange.
//		are partially FILLED may start have their VOLUME EXECUTED quantity
//		increase as more matching orders are executed, until they become fully filled.
//		Unfilled orders can also be CANCELLED.
//		Please design your system in such a way as to facilitate future changes,
//		because additional requirements may come up at short notice. Please
//		justify how your system can be easily changed to implement the following
//		requirement:
		System.out.println("QUANTITY");
